### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Im currently working on improving my skills as a web developer, mainly focusing on front-end but definitely leaping into back-end. Over the next few months I plan to learn Node.js, Express.js, Graphql and MongoDB. I currently have extensive knowledge in [React & Next], [Typescript & Javascript] and any CSS framework.

If you'd like to contact me I'm most active on discord: Fabi.#8499
